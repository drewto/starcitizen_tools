# starcitizen_tools

## Purpose

For the time being, this repo contains tools I threw together to help organize stuff related to a game called Star Citizen. I am mostly storing this so I can use it again in the future, but if you find it useful then I encourage you to use it!

## Tools

### [gift_calendar](gift_calendar)
A tool that reads your SC hangar logs and tells you the next time you can sell a ship of a given value without being restricted by CIG's gifting limits
